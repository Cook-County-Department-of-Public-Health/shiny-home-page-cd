## Home Page for Cook County Department of Public Health Communicable Disease Unit Shiny Apps

The Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) is a local health department that serves 2.5 million residents in the suburbs directly surrounding Chicago. The Communicable Disease Unit at CCDPH tracks around 15,000 cases of over sixty infectious diseases each year. We use this data to detect and prevent future illnesses and outbreaks in our community. We also want to make accessing this health data more flexible and user-friendly for the public as well as our internal staff. We have created a suite of R Shiny apps that allow users to: 
* explore aggregated case data
* compare infectious disease rates in our county through a health equity lens
* examine school vaccination trends and find and interpret their school’s vaccination rates
* track local flu and West Nile virus seasons as they happen
* access COVID-19 surveillance data

This is a Shiny app itself that has links and descriptions of each of the other Shiny apps we have developed.
